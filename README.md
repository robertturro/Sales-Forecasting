# Sales-Forecasting
Kaggle competition in which synthetic data is used to forecast the sale of four different books across six different countries and two different stores.

My EDA notebook, labeled "Plotly Visuals - TPS Sep 2022", consists of various graphs that were made using the plotly package in python. I used plotly to create various histograms, line graphs, pie charts, as well as a Sankey Diagram. From these graphs I collected various insights into how the data behaves, most notably how the number of books sold is greatly influenced by the day of the week and month of the year. Also I discovered that one store that sold many more books than the other. Using these insights I decided to test a few tree models: random forrest, ada boost, catboost lgbm, and xgb boost. Randomized Search CV was used on each tree model to determine each model's best cross validation score, with SMAPE as the evaluation metric, and optimal parameters. I created a function to find the model with the best cv score and found it to be the LGBM Regressor model. After applying the model to the test data set I was able to get a SMAPE value of 5.85 allowing me to place in the top 25% out of 1381 competitors.
